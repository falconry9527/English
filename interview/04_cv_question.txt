Q4 : Please talk about Merkle Tree
A Merkle Tree is a hash tree/binary tree:
leaf nodes store data hashes,
parent nodes store combinations of child hashes,
If any child hash changes,
all parent hashes change too, enabling efficient verification.

For a whitelist, we only need to store the root hash instead of all user addresses,
significantly reducing  costs of data storage .

For verification, you only need to provide the leaf hash and
the Merkle proof (which is an array of sibling node hashes).
