Goroutine：Goroutine is a lightweight thread，thousands of goroutines can run concurrently in a single Go program
Channel： Channel is Go’s communication mechanism, used for safely passing data between goroutines.
Go’s concurrency philosophy: Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.

Typical example (bin):
Worker Pool: the main goroutine generates tasks and sends them to a channel, 
while worker goroutines get tasks from the channel and process them.
