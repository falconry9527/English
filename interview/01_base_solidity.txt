Q1: EVM Data Storage:
Memory: Temporary storage, storing function parameters and return values .
Stack: Temporary storage, storing intermediate results during computations  within functions.
Storage: Permanent storage On-chain , storing global variables such as mappings and dynamic arrays.
Calldata: Read-only data , storing function parameters  from external calls.

Q2: Solidity Visibility:
public: Accessible from anywhere: within the contract, derived contracts, and externally.
internal: Accessible within the contract and derived (child) contracts.
private:  accessible only within the contract
external: Accessible only from contract outside

Q3: Differences between view, pure, and regular functions in Solidity:
view: can only read the state
pure: can neither read nor modify the state
regular: can both read and modify the state

Q4: Constructor: executed once when the contract is deployed, used to initialize state variables.
Q5: Mapping : Cannot be iterated, Commonly used for address: data

Q6: delegatecall vs call:
call: executes in the callee’s context and modifies the callee’s state.
delegatecall: executes in the caller’s context and modifies  caller’s state.

Q7: Difference between UUPS and Transparent Proxy
Transparent Proxy: The upgrade logic is located in in the proxy contract, which costs more gas
UUPS: The upgrade logic is located in the implementation contract, which costs less gas.

Q8: security problem:
1. Access Control: Ownable / AccessControl
1. Multi-signature:TimelockController + AccessControl
      Fees withdrawal by the admin require the consent of at least 3 out of 5 administrators.
2. Time-lock: TimelockController
3. Emergency Pause: Pausable
4. Reentrancy Attack : use ReentrancyGuard.

Q9: gas optimization :
Use uint256 instead of smaller integer types in storage to avoid the extra costs of packing and unpacking.
Use calldata for external function parameters to reduce costs of gas .
Use memory for temporary variables to reduce  costs of storage/gas .
Logic Optimization: Use Merkle-tree–based whitelists to reduce costs of storage/gas  .
