Q1: block-chain:
Chain-based data structure: Each block is linked sequentially in chronological order.
Distributed ledger: Immutability is ensured by cryptography and consensus mechanisms.

Q2: Consensus Mechanism:
Before a data block is added to the chain,
it must be validated and confirmed by the majority of nodes (server nodes/miners).
Consensus Mechanism of BTC is Proof of Work ,
Consensus Mechanism of ETH is Proof of Stake ,
Consensus (kənˈsensəs)

Q3: Proof of Work
Miners compete for the right to add new blocks to the blockchain by performing extensive complex hash computations.
this process consumes a significant amount of energy.

Q4 : Proof of Stake
Proof of Stake (PoS): Validators compete for the right to add new blocks to the blockchain by staking a certain amount of cryptocurrency,
this process that far less energy than Proof of Work

Q5 : Bitcoin mining
Hash=SHA256(SHA256(Version+Prev Hash+Merkle Root+Timestamp+Bits+Nonce))<Target
Miners repeatedly try different Nonce values
and double-hash the block header with SHA-256
until the hash is below the target,
earning the right to add the block.
The target is a difficulty value that a miner’s hash must be below to  mine a block successfully.

Q6 : The data structure of the btc :
A Bitcoin block consists of two main parts:
---Block Header
Version: Block version number
Previous Block Hash: Hash of the previous block
Merkle Root: Root of the Merkle tree of all transactions in the block
Timestamp: Block creation time
Bits: Target difficulty
Nonce: Random number used for Proof of Work
---Transaction List
Contains all transactions packed in the block, each with its own inputs and outputs.

Q7 : The data structure of the eth :
---Block Header
Parent Hash：父区块哈希
Uncle Hash：叔区块列表的哈希
Coinbase：出块矿工地址
State Root：状态树根
Transactions Root：交易树根
Receipts Root：收据树根
其他字段：Difficulty, Number, Gas Limit, Timestamp 等
---Transaction List
State Trie: Stores account states, including balances, nonces, and contract storage.
Transactions Trie: Stores all transactions in the block, ensuring transaction integrity.
Receipts Trie: Stores execution results and event logs for each transaction, used to verify outcomes.

Q8 :  Difference between lawyer1,lawyer2 and lawyer3
L1 is the base blockchain,
L2 is the scaling layer on top of it,
and L3 is the application layer built on L2.
