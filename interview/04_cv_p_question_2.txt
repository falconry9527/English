Q1 : Three methods of transferring ETH
transfer and send are used for simple ETH transfers, both with a 2300 gas limit; transfer throws an exception on failure, while send returns false on failure.
call is the most flexible method, suitable for complex contract interactions (including transfers and function calls), returns false on failure, but requires more error handling.

Q2:  interest of lending protocol
Each deposited token in the pool is associated with an accumulated interest
When the pool's liquidity changes (users lending, redeem, borrow, or repayBorrow), the accumulated interest per unit of token is updated.
The interest earned on the user's account change = the user's deposited assets in the lending pool × (new accumulated interest - last updated accumulated interest)

Q3 : Main methods of lending protocol
Main methods of  lending protocol ：
PoolCreation: Create a liquidity pool.
Lending/Supply: Lend assets to the protocol to increase liquidity and earn interest.
Redeem: Lenders redeem their deposits and interest.
Staking: Staking assets to the protocol or liquidity pool.
Borrow: Borrow assets from the protocol.
RepayBorrow: Borrowers repay their loans, including principal and interest.
Liquidation: When a borrower's collateralization ratio falls below a threshold, the protocol triggers liquidation.
